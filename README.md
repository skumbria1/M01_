**Objective:** 

Using .NET CLI:
1. Create a solution in a new folder
2. Create a project - a class library (ArrayHelper)
   - In that library implement a class, which allows to bubble-sort an array (both ASC/DESC). Note: do not use built-in sorting methods (like OrderBy, Sort, etc)
   - In that library implement a class, which allows to calculate the sum of all positive elements in a two dimensional array
   - Add necessary validations
3. Add ArrayHelper library to solution
4. Create a project - a class library (RectangleHelper)
   - In that library implement a class, which allows to calculate perimeter and square of a rectangle
   - Add necessary validations
5. Add RectangleHelper library to solution
6. Create a project - a console application, which demonstrates the functional of these two libraries
7. Add to solution
8. Build the solution
9. Run console application
10. Publish as self-contained assembly for Windows x64 and any other architecture of your choice (for example, ARM x86)
11. Collect all used commands to the script
